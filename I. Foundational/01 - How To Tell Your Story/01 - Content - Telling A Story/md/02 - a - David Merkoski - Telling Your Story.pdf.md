He found the frame. as we grow we discover sounds then words then language. and then we discover stories. and then we learn how to tell them.
For most of us, we learned about stories from listening to mom, dad or some larger than life teacher. And we learned to tell stories (that is, frame them) like those people did.At some point we have all been entranced, spellbound, or hooked on a story and we wanted to do the same thing. With OUR OWN story.
